# FaceAntiSpoofing
## Approach
Cuts frames in video data into images. Apply data augmentation methods in deep learning models to enhance data as well as increase the difficulty of the learning model. The model used for training in this problem is [Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030). The model achieved 96.52% accuracy on the test set.
The problem is run step-by-step above [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
